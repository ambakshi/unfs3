.SH NAME
unfsd \- NFS server process
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "/usr/sbin/unfsd [" options "]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B unfsd
program implements the MOUNT and NFS version 3 protocols. It listens for
client requests, performs them on the local filesystem of the server, and
then returns the results of the operations to the clients.
.P
At startup,
.B unfsd
reads the exports file,
.I /etc/exports
by default, to find out which directories are available to clients
and what options are in effect (see
.B EXPORTS FILE
section below for syntax and possible options).
.P
Normally, 
.B unfsd
should be run as the
.B root
user. It will then switch its effective
user and group id to the numbers listed in incoming NFS requests. This
means filesystem operations will be performed as if done by a local
user with the same ids. If the incoming request is for user or group
id 0 (meaning
.BR root "), " unfsd
will switch to the user and group id of the
.B nobody
user before performing filesystem operations (this is known as
.BR "root squashing" ")."
If the user
.B nobody
does not exist on the system, a user and group id of 65534 will be used.
This behavior can be modified by use of the
.B no_root_squash
and
.B all_squash
options in the exports file.
.P
If
.B unfsd
is running as a normal unprivileged user, no switching of the effective
user and group id will take place. Instead, all filesystem operations
will be performed with the id of the user running
.BR unfsd .
.SH RESTRICTIONS
Some NFS clients may attempt to perform operations that
.B unfsd
cannot fully support.
.TP
.B "Object Creation"
When creating filesystem objects, it is only possible to specify the
initial mode for the object. The initial user and group ownership,
object size, and timestamps cannot be specified and will be set to
default values.
.TP
.B "File Locking"
The network lock manager (NLM) protocol is not supported. This means that
clients may have to mount with special mount options, disabling locking
on the mounted NFS volume (nolock for Linux clients).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h
Display a short option summary.
.TP
.BI "\-e " "\<file\>"
Use the given file as the exports file, instead of using
.IR /etc/exports .
Note that the file needs to be specified using an absolute path.
.TP
.B \-u
Use an unprivileged port for NFS and MOUNT service. Normally,
.B unfsd
will use port number 2049, which is the standard port for NFS.
When this option is in effect, arbitrary ports chosen by the RPC library
will be used. You may need to use this option when running
.B unfsd
from a normal user account.
.TP
.BI "\-n " "\<port\>"
Use the specified port for the NFS service.
.TP
.BI "\-m " "\<port\>"
Use the specified port for the MOUNT service. The default is to
use port number 2049, the same as for the NFS service. You can use
the same port for both services if you want.
.TP
.B \-t
TCP only operation. By default,
.B unfsd
provides its services to clients using either UDP or TCP as communications
protocol. When this option is present, only TCP connections are
serviced.
.TP
.B \-p
Do not register with the portmapper. This will prevent other hosts from
finding out the port numbers used for the MOUNT and NFS services by
querying the portmap daemon. Clients
will need to manually specify the port numbers to use.
.TP
.B \-w
Allow the built-in file descriptor cache to expire writers. For
performance reasons,
.B unfsd
keeps file descriptors open across multiple READ or WRITE requests.
Normally, only READ file descriptors will be expired from the cache
when it fills up. Setting this option allows file descriptors
from WRITE operations to be expired, too. When this happens, pending
data will be written to the server filesystem. However, if an
error occurs while doing this, there is no way to notify the NFS
client of the error. A message indicating the problem will be sent
to the system log on the server.
.TP
.B \-c
Enable cluster extensions. This feature is only available when
.B unfsd
was compiled with cluster support. When this option is enabled, so-called
tagged files are handled differently from normal files, making it possible
to serve different file contents to different clients for the same filename.
See
.BR tags (7)
for a description of tagged files. This option causes a performance hit.
.TP
.BI "\-C" "\ <path>"
Limit the use of cluster extensions to a list of colon-seperated
directories. When this option is present, the performance hit caused by
clustering extensions only applies to the listed directories and their
subdirectories.
.TP
.B \-d
Debug mode. When this option is present,
.B unfsd
will not fork into the background at startup, and all messages that
would normally go to the system log go to stdout instead.
.SH SIGNALS
.TP
.BR "SIGTERM " "and " SIGINT
will cause
.B unfsd
to unregister itself from the portmapper and exit.
.TP
.B SIGHUP
will cause
.B unfsd
to re-read its configuration data. Currently, this means the program
will query the
.I passwd
database to find out the user and group id of user
.BR nobody .
.B unfsd
will also attempt to reload the exports file. If the exports file
contains errors,
.B unfsd
sends a warning message to the system log and nothing is exported until
the situation is corrected and another
.B SIGHUP
is sent.
.TP
.B SIGUSR1
will cause
.B unfsd
to output statistics about its filehandle and file descriptor cache
to the system log. For the filehandle cache, it will output the number
of filehandles in the cache, the total number of cache accesses, and a cache
hit and miss percentage. For the file descriptor cache, it will output
the number of currently held open READ and WRITE file descriptors.
.SH "EXPORTS FILE"
The exports file,
.I /etc/exports
by default, determines which directories on the server can be accessed
from NFS clients. An example:

.nf
# sample NFS exports file
/home            trusted(rw,no_root_squash) (ro)
"/with spaces"   weirdo
/usr             1.2.3.4(rw) 192.168.2.0/24(ro,all_squash)
/home/foo        bar(rw) 10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0(root_squash)
.fi

Comments start with a # character and cause the rest of the line to be
ignored. Extremely long exports can be split across multiple lines by
escaping the intermediate newlines with a backslash character.
.P
Each line starts with a directory that is to be exported. If
the directory name contains whitespace, it must be enclosed in double
quotes. To the right of the directory name, a list of client
specifications can be given. If this list is missing, the directory
is exported to everyone, using default options
.RB ( ro " and " root_squash ")."
.P
If the directory name contains symbolic links, they are expanded. This
means that you have to force
.B unfsd
to reload the exports file if the symlinks happen to change.
.P
Clients can be specified using either a hostname, an IP address, or
an IP network. Networks can be given by specifying the number of leading 1
bits in the netmask or by giving the full netmask. If the hostname is
empty, the directory is exported to everyone.
.P
Options can follow a client specification and have to be enclosed
in parenthesis, with the opening paren directly following the client
name or address. If no options are given,
.B ro
and
.B root_squash
are enabled by default. The following options are supported by
.BR unfsd :
.TP
.B root_squash
Enable root squashing, mapping all NFS request done with a user id of
0 to the user id of the
.B nobody
user. This option is enabled by default.
.TP
.B no_root_squash
Disable root squashing. When this option is present, NFS requests done
with a user id of 0 will be done as the
.B root
user of the server, effectively disabling all permissions checks.
.TP
.B all_squash
Squash all users. When this option is present, all NFS requests will
be done as the
.B nobody
user of the server.
.TP
.B no_all_squash
Don't squash all users. This option is enabled by default.
.TP
.B rw
Allow read and write access on the exported directory. When this option
is present, clients are allowed to modify files and directories on
the server.
.TP
.B ro
Allow only read access on the exported directory. When this option
is present, clients are not allowed to modify files and directories
on the server. This option is enabled by default.
.TP
.B removable
Consider this directory to be on a removable medium. When this option
is present,
.B unfsd
will not keep files open across multiple read or write requests. This
allows unmounting of the underlying filesystem at any time.
.TP
.B fixed
Consider this directory to be on a fixed medium. This options is enabled
by default and allows
.B unfsd
to keep files open between multiple read or write requests.
.TP
.B password=<password>
To be able to mount this export, the specified password is
required. The password should be given as a part of the path to mount,
as in "mount yourhost:@password:gazonk/tmp /mnt". One time passwords
are also supported. See the file "passwords.txt" for more information.
.PP
If options not present on this list are encountered by
.BR unfsd ,
they are silently ignored.
.SH BUGS
There are a few possible race conditions with other processes on the
server. They can happen if
.B unfsd
is performing an operation on a directory while another
process is simultaneously first (a) removing the directory and then (b)
creating a new directory of the same name. If this happens,
.B unfsd
will attempt to perform the operation on the wrong, new directory.
The time window in which this can happen is small.
.SH FILES
.TP 20
.I /etc/exports
