What's new or changed in 0.9.14
===============================

The server now accepts SET_TO_SERVER_TIME for atime and mtime
when creating file system objects.

The old maintainer email address doesn't work anymore and has
been replaced with a new one.

    testsuite's "basic" and "general" tests
  - improve filehandle integrity checking

Version 0.8.6

  - undo refusal to use "." and ".." since it confuses NetBSD clients
  - include inode generation number in filehandles whenever possible

Version 0.8.4

  - return XDEV error in RENAME and LINK if export options for given
    objects do not match (needed for squash options differences)

  - fix a serious bug in READDIR, cookie == 0 was handled incorrectly
  - make it build and run on NetBSD 1.6.1/i386
