UNFS3 (User-Space NFSv3 Server)
(C) 2003-2004, Pascal Schmidt <der.eremit@email.de>


INTRODUCTION
============

UNFS3 is a user-space implementation of the NFSv3 server
specification.

UNFS3 supports all NFSv3 procedures with the exception of the
READDIRPLUS procedure. It tries to provide as much information
to NFS clients as possible, within the limits possible from
user-space.

See the unfsd(8) manpage for restrictions imposed on NFS
operations (section RESTRICTIONS) and for possible races
with local file system activity (section BUGS).

It is not possible to export to netgroups or wildcard hostnames
via /etc/exports, all other addressing methods should work. The
following options are recognized in the exports file: ro, rw,
root_squash, all_squash, no_root_squash, no_all_squash. If
other options are present, they are ignored.

Cluster extensions compatible to the older ClusterNFS project
are supported when the source is configured with --enable-cluster.


SUPPORTED SYSTEMS
=================

Linux:		compiles and runs, passes Connectathon 2003 NFS
		testsuite's "basic" and "general" tests, survives
		fsx stress testing

Solaris: 	compiles and runs, survives light testing

NetBSD: 	compiles and runs, but there are compatibility
		problems with the in-kernel NFS client


Note that Solaris and NetBSD support is not checked for all releases,
so it may break at any time. If it does, a bug report is appreciated.


INSTALLATION
============

You will need gcc, lex (flex), and yacc (bison) to compile UNFS3.

	./configure
	make
	make install

Please read the manpage for information about command-line
options.

	man 8 unfsd

If you decide to modify the code yourself, you can run

	make dep
	
to append dependency information to the Makefile, so that make
knows which files depend on each other and recompiles all the
necessary files on changes.


CREDITS
=======

The design of unfs3's filehandle code owes much to the original NFSv2
universal user-space NFS server. Thanks to Mark Shand and Don Becker
for coming up with those concepts.
