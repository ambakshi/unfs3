uidmapping
----------
Unused. 


removable-fsidhash
------------------
This branch contains the following changes:

* When using passwords, the filehandles includes the password hash. 

* The -s option, for basic uid translation. 



removable-support
-----------------
Experimental ASCII-filehandles work. These changes will probably not
be merged with HEAD; they are pretty much obsoleted by the work on the 
"removable-fsidhash" branch. 


pharao90
--------
Main vendor branch.
