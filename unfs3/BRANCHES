uidmapping
----------
Unused. 


removable-fsidhash
------------------
This branch contains the following changes:

* Enhanced support for removable devices: Uses static fsid and
  filehandle for mountpoint. This makes it possible to mount/unmount
  the media, without needing to remount the NFS export. 

* When using passwords, the filehandles are scrambled with a password
  hash. 

* The -s option, for basic uid translation. 



removable-support
-----------------
Experimental ASCII-filehandles work. These changes will probably not
be merged with HEAD; they are pretty much obsoleted by the work on the 
"removable-fsidhash" branch.
